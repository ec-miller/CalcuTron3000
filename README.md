# CalcuTron3000

## The last Real Time Cloudless Pace Calculator made with React that you'll ever need!

WIP: future plan is for the CalcuTron3000 to have many different fitness calculators. If you'd like to create a component for a new calculation, feel free to submit a pull request.

Inspired by StephenGrider's React and Redux [class](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)?
