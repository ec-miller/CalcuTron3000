# CalcuTron3000

## The last React Real-Time Cloudless Pace Calculator that you'll ever need!

WIP: The goal is for CalcuTron3000 to have many different fitness calculators. I am working on calculation number 2 and a navbar right now.

If you'd like to create a component for a new calculation, feel free to submit a pull request ([do it!](https://giphy.com/explore/funny-dancing))

Inspired by StephenGrider's React and Redux [class](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
